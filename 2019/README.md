## 2019 Kotlin

Some solutions to some days of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

Using Kotlin _scripts_, although I developed them using an IDE.

Hats off to darvs, who game me some tricks and tips for command line usage.

### Executing on MacOS

Install Kotlin with brew:
`brew install kotlin`

Given a script name `puzzle1.kts`, execute so:
`kotlinc -script puzzle1.kts`

**Note: I was using `print` at first, but the line wasn't written. I had to changed to `println``**

### Environment
Tested on MacOS 10.15.1 with Kotlin version 1.3.61 (JRE 1.8.0_25-b17)
